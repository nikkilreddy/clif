"""
CLIF Triage Agent v8 — Kill-Chain State Machine
===================================================
Per-host attack stage progression tracking with decay.

Tracks the MITRE-aligned kill-chain position for each host based
on the sequence of suspicious actions observed. Used to:
  1. Provide kill_chain_stage and kill_chain_velocity features
  2. Boost scores for events at advanced attack stages
  3. Pass kill-chain context to Hunter for investigation prioritization

Stages:
  0 = none       — No suspicious activity
  1 = recon      — Enumeration, scanning, failed auth probing
  2 = access     — Initial access (successful auth after failures)
  3 = execution  — Process creation, command execution
  4 = persistence — Config changes, service installation, scheduled tasks
  5 = exfil      — Data access, large transfers, unusual destinations

Memory: ~100 bytes per host. 100K hosts = 10 MB.
